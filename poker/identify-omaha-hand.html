    <h2>Omaha Hold'em - 3 from the board, 2 from the hole</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Here are some hints for identifying Omaha poker hands, sorted from highest to lowest rank:</p>
        <p>In Omaha, you must use exactly three cards from the shared community cards (the "board")
            and exactly two cards from your own hand (the "hole") to form your best five-card poker hand. The following
            strategy
            may be helpful - with this approach you can stop looking as soon as you find a match.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Check for straight flush possibilities:
                <ul>
                    <li>Arrange the community cards mentally from highest to lowest.</li>
                    <li>Search for three community cards that are in a 5-card span (example J-8-7) and of the same suit.
                    </li>
                    <li>If found, see if you have two hole cards of the same suit that can complete the straight flush.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Check for four of a kind:
                <ul>
                    <li>Note that four of a kind is only possible if there is a pair or three of a kind on the board.
                    </li>
                    <li>See if you can turn the pair or three of a kind on the board into four of a kind with your hole
                        cards.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Check for a full house:
                <ul>
                    <li>Identify if there's a pair or three of a kind in the community cards.</li>
                    <li>Verify if you can form a full house using your two hole cards.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Check for flush possibilities:
                <ul>
                    <li>Look for at least three community cards of the same suit.</li>
                    <li>If there are at least three of one suit, check if you have two hole cards of the same suit to
                        complete the flush.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Check for straights:
                <ul>
                    <li>Look for at least three community cards that are within a five-card span (e.g., 7-6-4 or J-T-8).
                    </li>
                    <li>If found, note the missing cards and check your hole cards for two cards that can fill the gaps
                        to complete a straight.</li>
                    <li>Be aware that if there are more than three in a 5-card span on the board, you can only use 3
                        still. In this situation,
                        hole cards that pair the board can be very useful!</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Check for three of a kind:
                <ul>
                    <li>Identify if there are any two identical cards on the board, or a pair in the hole that matches a
                        board card to make three of a kind.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Check for two pair hands:
                <ul>
                    <li>If there's a pair in the community cards and a pair in your hole cards, you can form two pairs.
                    </li>
                    <li>If there are two distinct community cards that match one each of your hole cards, you can form
                        two pairs.</li>
                    <li>If there's a pair on the board and one card in your hole cards that matches another community
                        card, you can form two pairs.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Check for pair:
                <ul>
                    <li>Identify if there's a single card on the board that matches with a card in your hole cards, or a
                        pair on the board.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Evaluate high cards and kicker strength:
                <ul>
                    <li>If you don't have any strong combinations, pick the highest three cards on the board and the
                        highest two cards in the hole.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
