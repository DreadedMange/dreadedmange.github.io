    <h2>Texas Hold'em - Pick the best 5 cards</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Click the best 5 cards and then click Confirm. Here are some hints for identifying Holdem poker
            hands,
            sorted
            from highest to lowest rank:</p>
        <p>In Holdem, you find the best 5 cards using the the shared community cards (the "board")
            and two cards from your own hand (the "hole"). You do not necessarily need to use your hole cards.
            The
            following
            strategy
            may be helpful - with this approach you can stop looking as soon as you find a match.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Check for straight flush possibilities:
                <ul>
                    <li>Arrange the community cards mentally from highest to lowest.</li>
                    <li>Search for three or more community cards that are in a 5-card span (example J-T-8-7) and
                        of
                        the
                        same suit.
                    </li>
                    <li>If found, see if your hole cards can complete (or extend!) the straight flush.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Check for four of a kind:
                <ul>
                    <li>Note that four of a kind is only possible if there is a pair or three of a kind on the
                        board.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Check for a full house:
                <ul>
                    <li>Identify if there's a pair (or two) and/or three of a kind in the community cards.</li>
                    <li>Verify if you can form a full house using your two hole cards if needed.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Check for flush possibilities:
                <ul>
                    <li>Look for at least three community cards of the same suit.</li>
                    <li>If there are at least three of one suit, check if you can make a flush using one or two
                        of
                        your
                        hole cards.</li>
                    <li>Note that even if the board flush cards are higher than the ones in your hand, the flush
                        hole
                        cards will determine how your hand compares to other players.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Check for straights:
                <ul>
                    <li>Arrange the community cards mentally from highest to lowest.</li>
                    <li>Search for three or more community cards that are in a 5-card span (example J-T-8-7).
                    </li>
                    <li>If found, see if your hole cards can complete (or extend!) the straight.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Check for three of a kind:
                <ul>
                    <li>When looking for three of a kind, note that it is not possible unless you have a pair in
                        the
                        hole that matches a card on the board ("a set"),
                        or if there is a pair on the board and you have one in the hole ("trips").</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Check for two pair hands:
                <ul>
                    <li>If there's a pair in the community cards and a pair in your hole cards, you can form two
                        pairs.
                    </li>
                    <li>If there are two distinct community cards that match one each of your hole cards, you
                        can
                        form
                        two pairs.</li>
                    <li>If there's a pair on the board and one card in your hole cards that matches another
                        community
                        card, you can form two pairs (which form a "two-pair" hand).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Check for pair:
                <ul>
                    <li>Identify if there's a single card on the board that matches with a card in your hole
                        cards,
                        or a
                        pair on the board.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Evaluate high cards and kicker strength:
                <ul>
                    <li>If you don't have any strong combinations, pick the highest five cards available.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
